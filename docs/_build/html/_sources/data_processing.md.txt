# Task 1: Data Processing 


## Exploratory Data Analysis 
Code: https://github.com/A-Telfer/telfer-ecg-heartbeat-categorization-task/blob/master/notebooks/1.0-telfer-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb

In the exploratory data analysis notebook we identified the composition of the dataset in terms of data size, types, and range. We found that the target classes were very imbalanced (Table 1). By describing the data we found that the signals were normalized between [0, 1] and were followed by trailing zeros to pad shorter signals.

We visualized sample signals from each class, noting several aspects that signals differed such as peak locations, mean amplitude, and signal length.
